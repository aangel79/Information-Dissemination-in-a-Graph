## Sample Commands for program execution:

```
python Netshield.py
```


## Input
Adjacency matrix is required as input.<br/>
Input data can be changed by changing "adj_mat" at **line 16**.<br/>
K is by default 4, it can be changed by changing the value of K at **line 97**.<br/>

## Output
The output is the graph after removing K nodes found in [plots](plots).<br/>
The output graph is visualized before and after removing K nodes.<br/>
The values of Max-flows before and after removing K nodes are printed in the respective graphs.<br/>

If the user wants to provide a graph manually for testing:<br/>
The values of nodes and edges can be entered at **line 121 ans 123**.
